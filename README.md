This is a basic Website made with HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript and Bootstrap components for interactivity.

JavaScript usage:
- i used vanilla js to make a little quiz about me and to keep track of the total score
- if the user gets everything right I used css-animation to make  blinking text

Bootstrap usage:
- all pasges: sticky navbar element for navigating the website, with a little website icon included
- projects page: cards with image, little description and link to GitHub
- cv page: collapsable accordion to focus on a specific section
- all bootstrap components have been modified with css containers
